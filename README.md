## Horror House game

In this project I have developed a text-based interactive experience-game based on a Halloween-inspired theme. The game takes place in a scary, haunted house, where you are trapped, and you have to find the hidden key to escape. The game asks you questions about how you want to orientate in the house and what you want to do (i.e. choose between different rooms and actions). In the different locations you get to choose between two different actions, which will affect what will happen to you. If you choose the wrong action you may die, but you will have the opportunity to try again. Good luck!
